<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>


<p align="center">
System is down (Intake): <br/>
<img width="450" alt="1 System is Down (created the following Ticket as an end user)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d402122-1128-4aed-bfd4-6119a49c4c05" />
</p>
<p>
As an end-user, I created the following ticket: the entire mobile/online banking system is down.
</p>
<br />

Observing the ticket's properties: <br/>

</p>
<p>
Now, as a help desk agent (John Doe), we observe the ticket properties depending on priority, department,SLA or whose assigned to. 
</p>
<br />

<p align="center">
Set Properties to the ticket: <br/>

</p>
<p>
Still as John Doe we will set properties to the ticket by updating the SLA to Sev-A (1hr, 24/7) and assigning it to the Online-banking team.
</p>
<br />

<p align="center">
communication: <br/>
<img width="450" alt="4 Assigning Ticket To our Selfs As Jane to Complete" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dae16c5-d9fc-4477-a97e-52bb6b013c06" />
</p>
<p>
As Agent Jane Doe we made a slight change and assigned the ticket to ourselfs with a description.
</p>
<br />
<p align="center">
working the issue: <br/>
<img width="450" alt="5 As Jane we determined the root cause" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/810e561a-12d7-4b26-8086-2aef7a9e1519" />
</p>
<p>
As Jane Doe we determined the root cause was related to the recent updates and we have taken the proper steps to get the online banking back and running.
</p>
<br />
<p align="center">
Resolution(Ticket closed): <br/>
<img width="450" alt="6 Ticket resolved as Jane (Ticket closed)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df0c8e54-75a0-4ef2-8c19-139e1d039ba1" />
<p>
Since the issue was resolved the last thing to do is close out the ticket as Agent Jane Doe.
</p>
